Answers below
=========================================

























Question 1: What is inheritance?


Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class can inherit the properties of another class. This includes methods and
variables.



Question 2: What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the ability for a method to have different implementations through class hierarchy. This is useful for
creating a method that can be used by multiple classes. Method overloading and method overriding are examples of
polymorphism.



Question 3: What is an abstract class?


An abstract class is either a class with an abstract method or it is a class that is declared to be abstract. An
abstract class has an undefined method. A new abstract class cannot be called because it is not defined. A class has to
be created that extends the abstract class and define the abstract method in the new class.



Question 4:  Does the below code work? Why?

Bird b = new Bird();
Birb b.makeSound();


No, the below code will not work because you cannot create an instance of an abstract class. The Bird class is abstract
and has undefined methods. The code doesn't know how to compile the abstract undefined methods.




Question 5 Why does e.makeSound() and p.makeSound() have different outputs when this code runs?


The Eagle class and the Penguin class have unique definitions for the makeSound() method. When you call e.makeSound()
the Eagle class will output the definition of makeSound() in the Eagle class. When you call p.makeSound() the Penguin
class will output the definition of makeSound() in the Penguin class. This is an example of polymorphism.
