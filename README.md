# CS-2050-Examples
This is a Repo to include examples to run from CS-2050 lectures

How to navigate the examples:

1: Select the fold of material you would like to review

2: select src folder

The java files will contain code for main and classes used, if you want to run the examples yourself you are welcom to copy the code or repo for the code.
Make sure to keep the class files inside src with main. Questions will be in main! The question may tell you to go to a different file, but if you are following the questions they will exist in main.

Play around with the code examples! Make your own and feel free to do whatever you want with it! If you have issues running it, Let me know! I am happy to help get this code up and running on your machine!

There will be an Answers.txt in each folder. Please only look in that after self reviewing the content and going through the main and class files.

If you have any questions please reach out to me!
