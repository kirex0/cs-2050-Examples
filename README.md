# CS-2050-Examples
This is a Repo to include examples to run from CS-2050 lectures

How to navigate the examples:

1: Select the fold of material you would like to review

2: select src folder

The java files will contain code for main and classes used, if you want to run the examples yourself you are welcom to copy the code or repo for the code.
Make sure to keep the class files inside src with main.

There will be an Answers.txt in each folder. Please only look in that after self reviewing the content and going through the main and class files.

If you have any questions please reach out to me!
