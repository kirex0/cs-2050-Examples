Answers below
=========================================















Question 1: What data type is b1?

b1 is declared as a String. It is a string because when we declare Box<String>, the <> defines what data type the
Generic will be.


Question 2: What data type is b2?

b2 is declared as a Double.


Quesion 3: Can we use another class for the data type for box?

Yes, we can use any class for the data type for box. We can also use primitive data types such as int, double, char,
etc.


Question 4: Can you run this? Try it! What happens and why?

No, this code will not run. It returned an error because we are trying to compare 2 different data types. Yes it is the
same class but the data types cannot be compared this way.


Question 5: What is the first name of the person object being referenced to in boxOfPerson?

The first name of the person object being referenced to in boxOfPerson is John. It does not get updated with p1 = p2
because the reference of p1 was changed, not the values. So the value of the reference in boxOfPerson is still "John"
"Doe" 30. p1 now references the person object that p2 references.
